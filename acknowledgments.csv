I owe to Rainer Hammwoehner and Hans Rott not only the kind invitation but also the conceptual pressure that made me start working on this paper. A first version of the paper was then presented at the Department of Communication Science of the University of Salerno (Fisciano, Italy, 10 May 2006), and I wish to thank Roberto Cordeschi for that opportunity and the feedback I received in that occasion. The paper was further improved and discussed at the “Workshop on Information Theories”, organized by Juerg Kohlas and Giovanni Sommaruga at Fribourg University (Münchenwiler, Switzerland, 17–18 May 2006). They, the attendees, and especially Rolf Haenni and Jeremy Seligman provided some very helpful comments. A new version was the subject of an invited talk at the Department of Philosophy of the University of Siena (Siena, 14 June 2006), where I took advantage of a long discussion with Claudio Pizzi on secondorder probabilities. This led to a paper presented at a seminar organised by the Computer Science Department of Mälardalen University (Västerås, Sweden, September 2006), where I was kindly invited by Gordana Dodig Crnkovic. The discussion with the participants and especially with Gordana, Susan Stuart and Lars-Göran Johansson generated several improvements. The issue of hardwired questions was discussed there. The final version of the article then became the ISI Samuel Lazerow Memorial Lecture I delivered at the University of Arizona (Tucson, 8 February 2007). I am grateful to Don Fallis for the invitation and to the Research Group on the History and Philosophy of Information Access, the School of Information Resources and Library Science and The International Visitors Fund for the kind support.

This had two surprising consequences. First, the volume of response was astounding: initial responses together with follow-up discussions amounted to one hundred pages. Second, given the consensus, I expected the experts to identify deep flaws in these “heretical thoughts.” Yet this did not happen. I was corrected, informed, and guided on many matters and yet my basic argument for biological essentialism seemed to me to survive fairly intact. The experts I am indebted to for their heroic attempts to set me straight at that point are Peter Godfrey-Smith, Paul Griffiths, Stephen Schwartz, Stephen Stich, and particularly, Joseph LaPorte, Karen Neander, and Samir Okasha.

WOS:000286031100006,"Peter Lipton was my friend and colleague. Our careers overlapped in a number of ways. I was one of the examiners for his PhD. Then he visited Cambridge for a year when I was a lecturer in History and Philosophy of Science. Some time later I left for London, and Peter was appointed to the vacant post, taking over my office and telephone number. He made such a difference to the Department that it is hard to believe he is not still there. He was a wonderful person and is very much missed. I am glad to dedicate this paper to his memory.",,,1217
WOS:000286031100007,"Among the many fond memories of my time as a graduate student in the Cambridge HPS Department, those of meetings with Peter Lipton stand out. Peter was an exemplary doctoral supervisor; his generosity with his time and ideas was extraordinary, and it was virtually impossible to walk away from a supervision with him without having learnt something. One of Peter’s most remarkable gifts—in addition to his legendary sense of humour, of course—was his ability, and genuine desire, to help one formulate one’s own arguments better, even when he disagreed with their overall philosophical direction. One of the last emails I received from Peter, only a few weeks before his death, ended on an upbeat note: ‘You sound busy, productive, and happy. That’s the way to be.’ It is certainly the way I remember Peter to be.

I would like to thank Ben Blumson, Anjan Chakravartty, John D. Greenwood and Michael Pelczar for helpful comments on an earlier version of this paper.",,,1218
WOS:000286031100008,"Peter Lipton was my Ph.D. supervisor. He was charged with helping me to acquire philosophical skill and know-how, and he discharged those duties with grace and humour. I hope to pay tribute to Peter by exploring this process in the context of the epistemology of testimony, one of his enduring interests (Lipton, 1998, 2007).

I presented earlier versions of this paper at the Universities of Aberdeen, Stockholm and St Andrews, and at the Peter Lipton Memorial Conference at the University of Cambridge; I benefited a great deal from questions and suggestions on all those occasions. In addition, I am grateful to Anjan Chakravartty, Jeremy Fantl, Martin Kusch, and Mark Sprevak for comments which raised more issues than I could deal with here.",,,1219

Anjan Chakravartty provided astute, meticulous and patient guidance as editor. I regret that I couldn’t take up these topics with Peter (z”l), whom I admired so much as a philosopher and as a person. We met as beginning assistant professors, and, ever since, his friendship and kindness have meant a great deal to me.",,,1220
WOS:000286031100002,"Thanks to Michael DePaul, Fritz Warfield and Anjan Chakravartty for providing helpful comments on earlier versions of this paper. And thanks above all to Peter Lipton. Peter was my first epistemology and philosophy of science professor, when I was a freshman at Williams College in 1990. It was his superb teaching that sparked my own love of these subjects, and it was his interest in the nature of understanding in particular that inspired my own interest in the topic. I wish I could say that I also picked up some of Peter’s inherent goodness and decency, as well as his natural charm and penetrating mind—but these are not the kinds of things that can be passed on, unfortunately. What I can say is that Peter was, and continues to be, well loved, as well as greatly missed.",,,1221
WOS:000286031100003,"As is exemplified by this paper, my own thinking about problems in the epistemology of science is not simply deeply indebted to Peter Lipton, but has developed within a framework that Peter constructed. Peter’s work and the way in which he wrote philosophy and indeed the way in which he approached the subject, will remain exemplary for me and for many others for a long time to come. Less apparent to others is the way in which Peter promoted the ideas and careers of younger philosophers. I, with many others, benefitted hugely from Peter’s kindness, his advice, and his unending willingness to engage in philosophical discussion. We have so much to be grateful to him for.

As regards this paper, I am grateful for very helpful comments to audiences at the Universities of Bristol, Edinburgh, Exeter, Hertfordshire, and Stirling, and at the Peter Lipton memorial conference held in Cambridge on 1 November 2008. I am grateful also to Alex Broadbent, Mark Sprevak, and Anjan Chakravartty for stimulating conversations on the topics raised in this paper, and again to Anjan Chakravartty for comments on a draft.",,,1222
WOS:000286031100004,"This paper originated in a conversation with Peter Lipton after a lecture by Andy Clark in Cambridge. Andy gave a fascinating series of case studies in cognitive science that were intended to encourage one to believe in HEC. The inference appeared to be an IBE: HEC was presented as the best explanation of those case studies. In the conversation, both Peter and I were drawn to the thought that this strategy would not work. Peter asked: ‘What difference would it make if the environmental features are mental?’ We struggled to find any. Sadly, our discussions were cut short by Peter’s death. I hope that Peter would have been sympathetic with the general line of this paper, even if not with the details. It would have been much better for his input.

I was an undergraduate student of Peter, then a graduate student, and finally one of his colleagues at the Department of History and Philosophy of Science and King’s College, Cambridge. Among Peter’s many talents he possessed an uncanny ability, which could be given either a HEC or a HEMC parsing, to extend the mental abilities of those around him. Seminars, talks, supervisions, and conversations would be transformed by his presence, no matter what the topic. Often one did not know what one was thinking until it was refined, clarified, and infinitely improved by Peter (‘Liptonised’). Working with Peter was both a friendly experience and engendered an almost magical sense of clarity. Like many others, I was looking forward to frequent future discussions and collaborations with Peter. Sadly, none of us will have this opportunity, and all our mental lives are considerably the worse for it.

I would like to thank Anjan Chakravartty, Andy Clark, Ken Aizawa, Zoe Drayson, Rob Rupert, and Mike Wheeler for helpful comments on an earlier draft of this paper. A version of this paper was presented at the ZiF conference in Bielefeld, Germany in November 2009.",,,1223
WOS:000286031100005,"I would like to thank Anjan Chakravartty, Stephen John, Martin Kusch, Amber Lincoln, Christina Mcleish, Kyle Stanford, and Masahiro Yamada for very helpful comments and conversations.

The idea behind this article took shape in a string of conversations with the Late Professor Peter Lipton. I wrote an M.Phil. dissertation that aimed to evaluate Peter’s account of explanation, with Peter himself as supervisor. During these early supervisions, Peter’s incisive philosophical mind was always tempered by unusual levels of patience and empathy. These interactions encouraged me to apply to become a doctoral student under Peter. As a Ph.D. student, I decided to work on questions of reference, and Peter showed the same clarity, fairness, and generosity. This article relates my M.Phil. to my Ph.D. dissertation. In writing it, as with every paper, Peter’s voice keeps me light, guides me forward. In gratitude for the pleasure those years were, I dedicate this article to our collective memory of Peter.",,,1224
WOS:000286031100009,"I wasn’t certain I wanted to pursue a career in academic philosophy until my doctoral supervisor, Peter Lipton, exemplified for me the very best of what it could mean to do so. His penetrating sharpness, unfailing kindness, and the generosity with which he displayed these qualities on a daily basis helped me to see that even a highly imperfect attempt to emulate them would be something worth doing. For that enduring inspiration, I dedicate this paper and, indeed, whatever small success I hope one day to achieve in emulation, to him.

A number of people assisted me greatly in thinking about the topics of this paper: I owe thanks to Axel Gelfert, Ron Giere, Margie Morrison, Alan Richardson, Alex Rueger, Mark Sprevak, and Paul Teller, as well as audiences at the Idealization, Abstraction, and Scientific Models Workshop (at UAM-I and UNAM, Mexico City), Models and Simulations III, and the annual meetings of the Canadian Society for Epistemology and the Canadian Philosophical Association.",,,1225

Peter was my ‘second’ supervisor, when my primary supervisor went on leave. However, Peter patiently read as many drafts as a primary supervisor would, despite the fact that, by his own admission, the topic of my thesis gave him a headache. Peter was always a tremendous source of encouragement, wisdom, jokes and, of course, devastating criticism, always delivered with the greatest kindness.

They noted the long prom- inence of mechanistic language in biology (e.g., in the vitalism/mechanism controversy), but their ultimate goal, quite different from that of this article, was to defend the position that came to be known as functionalism in philosophy of mind, according to which the proper characterization of a mechanism was abstract, not tied to particular realizations of components.

Researching this topic, we have incurred debts and we acknowl- edge them with gratitude. The staff of the Hoover Institution Ar- chives in charge of the Sir Karl Popper Collection provided copies of most of the correspondence used in this article and Ms. Carol Ledenham searched in archival material for what we believed to be a lost element of correspondence. Dr. Manfred Lube, University of Klagenfurt, helpfully answered our queries to him. Staff in our respective university libraries went out of their way to obtain a number of materials, otherwise inaccessible to us, which proved to be important to this project. Professors Walter Gulick (Montana State University) and Martin Moleski, S. J. (Canisius College), along with Rafe Champion (inde- pendent scholar), provided us with substantive information and advice, enriching our discussion of several important details. Dr. Evelyn McBride, a native Austrian, refined our German to English translations of Popper’s letters to Polanyi. Dr. John Preston (University of Reading) provided us with a copy of his article on Feyerabend and Polanyi which appeared in Appraisal (1997), and Professor Alan Musgrave (University of Otago) provided us with copy of a relevant part of his PhD thesis. Dr. Peter Vickers (Univer- sity of Leeds) examined archival material of the British Society for the Philosophy of Science to verify the date on which Polanyi read his paper, ‘The Stability of Beliefs,’ to the London Philosophy of Sci- ence group (P.

WOS:000337365600002,"Although the two authors collaborated on all aspects of the paper, the philosophical parts were mainly the work of Donald Gillies, and the mathematical parts of Aidan Sudbury. In particular the proofs of Theorems 1 and 2 were due to Aidan Sudbury. Both authors would like to acknowledge the very important contribution to the paper of Christian Hennig. In early discussions, it was Christian Hennig who made the key points which led to the mathematical formulation of the problem in Section 6, and he also made the interesting comment on the conditions of Theorem 1, which we have included as Section 8. However, Christian Hennig’s philosophy of probability and statistics is rather different from the one presupposed in this paper. A general view of his philosophy is to be found in Hennig (2010), and he is at the moment developing it in more detail.&Earlier drafts of this paper were read at the International Workshop on Causal Inference in the Health Sciences, which Maria Carla Galavotti and Raffaella Campaner organised in Bologna on 27-28 May 2011, and at a meeting of the Kent-UCL Causality group, held in UCL on 11 August 2011. Many comments were received at these meetings – some favourable, and some highly critical, indicating the controversial nature of the material. Later we received further comments, again some favourable and some highly critical, on subsequent drafts of the paper. We have tried to take into account both types of comment in revising the paper, and would like to thank those who made comments, particularly Carlo Berzuini, Raffaella Campaner, Nancy Cartwright, Brendan Clarke, David Corfield, Philip Dawid, Maria Carla Galavotti, Phyllis McKay Illari, Judea Pearl, Federica Russo, Jon Williamson, and several anonymous referees.",,,1925

The focus was on the situation of early-career researchers. The workshop and panel discussion was funded by the Andrea von Braun Foundation (see http://www.wissphil.de/index.php?site=gwp2013&subsite=panel, last access August 6, 2013).

We would also like to thank the colleagues and students who organized the conference in Hanover and made it possible that the event could take place in such a fruitful atmosphere. This paper is the theoretical counterpart of a paper that addresses the practical implications for early-career researchers and research-related institutions with respect to funding and job profiles in interdisciplinary contexts in philosophy of science (Kaiser, Kronfeldner, Meunier (forthc.), “Problems and Prospects of Interdisciplinary Philosophy of Science: A Report from the Workbench,” Briefe zur Interdisziplinarität).",,,2382

Members of the research project were Arianna Borrelli, Robert Harlander, Peter Mättig, Friedrich Steinle, and myself. This paper initially goes back to a presentation at the 2010 “Models and Simulations 4” meeting in Toronto. Earlier drafts were written together with Arianna Borrelli in 2011 and 2012 and submitted to this journal in May 2012; they were drawing upon her continued empirical work in analyzing the model landscape in the Higgs sector and her historical expertise. A shortened and co-authored version has since appeared as Borrelli and Stöltzner (2013). In early 2014, the philosophical part of this paper has been revised so as to reflect the fact that, in July 2012, CERN announced the discovery of a SM Higgs boson and the ongoing debates in our broader research group. I am most grateful to all of them for comments on presentations and earlier drafts of this paper.

The title of this paper is inspired by Callender and Cohen’s article “There Is No Special Problem about Scientific Representation” (2006). Callender and Cohen argue that the prob- lems of scientific representation are just the problems of representation in general and thus that the proposed solutions for the latter can be applied to the former. Similarly, I argue that the problems involved in establishing the claim that nonhuman animals mindread are no different from the problems involved in establishing any theoretical claim in science. Thus, the proposed solutions to the latter can be applied to the former.",,,2718

I dedicate it to my mentor Professor Istvan Nemeti, and my present is an answer to a question of his. The variety of cylindric algebras of infinite dimensions endowed with the merry go round identities fails to have the amalgamation property. I came to know about this question back in Budapest in 2006, when together with Professor Hajnal Andreka we were discussing the open questions in Pigozzi (1971). Professor Nemeti had a copy of Pigozzi’s paper, that was obviously excessively used and re-used with question marks scattered all over. Miraculously I was able to obtain a photocopy, which I still have, with Istvan Nemeti’s questions in his own writing still there, but barely. One of my results here settles one of these scribbled question marks. Many more of Nemeti’s scribbled question marks were settled in my dissertation under his supervision, and some other question marks were jointly settled with Judit Madarasz, witness Madárasz and Sayed-Ahmed (2007).",,,4521

WOS:000374686700013,"I am grateful to Gerhard Schurz and Alexander Gebharter for organizing this discus- sion, and to each of those who have contributed. Gerhard’s insightful and diverse contributions mark him as one of the contemporary philosophers I most admire. Alexander’s thinking about causal representation has been at the philosophical fore- front, and I look forward to much more from him.
For the most part, but not always, I have taken the essays collected here as starting points for elaborations of my views and philosophical concerns rather than as criti- cisms to be rebutted. Where I have misunderstood, my apologies. Almost all of the contributions address my work on causal inference in one way or another, and, except for the “problem of old evidence,” ignore my earlier work, for example on “bootstrap testing.” I am grateful to the contributors for that as well.",,,4658

Barteld Kooi gave brilliant opposition during the Changing Minds workshop. Giacomo Bonanno wisely filled an important gap in the references for this contribution; this resulted in many changes, and most importantly in the addition of the appendix containing the detailed comparison with (Board 2004). Constructive suggestions by the anonymous referee resulted in the addition of a section listing the (partial) fulfilment of AGM requirements.

The basic theme of this paper was thus first proposed in these two contexts, although it was at that time based on Lewis’ (1986) notion of haecceitism. It was first presented in some detail and with the version of haecceitism adopted here in the con- ference in honor of David Armstrong, Properties, Modalities and States of Affairs, Konstanz, January 2003, where professor Armstrong and Barry Smith offered valuable comments and encouragment. Claudio Garola has patiently clarified for me some physical matters and provided bibliographic suggestions.

WOS:000299751800007,"This paper has benefited in two ways from the work of Mark Bedau. First, two of his papers on life have influenced my thinking about: (i) the normativity of the kind of teleology appropriate to living systems (Bedau 1992); and (ii) one sense in which life might be a sort of core-dependent homonym (Bedau 1998)—though, to be sure, that is not how he frames the matter. More proximately, he subjected an earlier draft of this paper to a series of insightful and challenging criticisms. Although I am doubtful that I have met them all satisfactorily, I am confident that the paper has been improved by his criticisms. I am grateful as well to another referee, Meg Scharle, who offered a different sort of extremely useful response. Again, though I cannot say with confidence that I have met all her worries, I feel sure that the paper is clearer for trying.

I have tried to correct the errors they pointed out and have made some minor revisions, but their suggestions for enlargement I have declined on the principle that new patches on old cloth are to be avoided (Mark 2:21). One criticism made by the referees was that references to similar work in computer science are missing. Yes, here I must plead guilty of ignorance.

Graham Oppy provided a Church–Fitch-like proof with explanation content, although he used that proof in an attempt to show that a certain cosmological argument begs the question (with this I disagree, see Gale and Pruss). Oppy credited Lloyd Humberstone (Oppy 2000, p. 347) with pointing out the similarity of his argumentation to Fitch’s reasoning.
